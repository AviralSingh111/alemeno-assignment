WORKFLOW:-

1. The Courses get a tag of open,closed or in progres based on the JSON field. You can search any course by its name and instructor's name.
2. On Clicking a course you can see a detailed Page. If the course is 'Open' there will be an enroll now button. Clicking on the button will add it to the student dashboard.
3. The student dashboard initially contains courses that are in Progress with random numbers of progress bar. You can mark them as complete and their 'In progress' Tag will be changes to 'Completed' on the the Home Page.
4. If you click on 'Enroll Now' button of any Open course then that course will be set to in progress and be shown in the Dashboard.
